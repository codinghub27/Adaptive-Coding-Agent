# Architecture

## Adaptive Coding & Problem-Solving Agent

> Core principle: **the agent does not optimize for giving the answer. It
> optimizes for helping the user solve the problem independently.**

## Architecture flow (one screen)

```
USER (text / code / image)
   → Input Understanding (vision/OCR for images)
   → Intent Classifier (DSA / debug / explain / review / concept / ...)
   → Learner Profile + Conversation Memory
   → Teaching Planner (difficulty, help level, strategy)
   → Specialized agents: DSA Solver (hint ladder) | Debugger | Code Explainer
   → Knowledge RAG (Qdrant + BM25 + reranker)
   → Code Execution Sandbox (Docker) → Verification
   → Response Generator (hint / explanation / code)
   → Learning Events → Learner Profile update
   → LangSmith evaluation
```

The whole graph is orchestrated with **LangGraph**; each specialized capability
is a subgraph.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| API | FastAPI |
| Orchestration | LangGraph |
| Validation | Pydantic v2 |
| ORM / DB | SQLAlchemy 2.0 + PostgreSQL |
| Vector store | Qdrant |
| Retrieval | dense embeddings + BM25 hybrid + reranker |
| Code intelligence | Python `ast`, Tree-sitter, static analysis |
| Execution | Docker sandbox (isolated, resource-limited) |
| Observability | LangSmith |
| Frontend | Streamlit first, React/Next.js later |
| Cache / queue (later) | Redis, optional Celery |
